# Langtons-Ant

Langton’s Ant rules: the ant is places onto the board that is filled with white spaces, and starts moving forward. For each step forward, the Langton’s ant
will follow two rules:
1) If the ant is on a white space, turn right 90 degrees and change the space to black
2) If the ant is on a white space, turn left 90 degrees and change the space to white
Then the ant moves to the next step and continues moving forward. The ant follows these rules until the number of steps runs out.
